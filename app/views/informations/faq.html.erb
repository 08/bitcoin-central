    <h2>What is Bitcoin?</h2>
    <p>
      Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer digital currency. Peer-to-peer means that there is no central authority to issue new money or keep track of transactions. Instead, these tasks are managed collectively by the nodes of the network. Advantages:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Bitcoins can be sent easily through the Internet, without having to trust middlemen.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transactions are designed to be irreversible.
      </li>
      <li>
        Be safe from instability caused by fractional reserve banking and central banks. The limited inflation of the Bitcoin systemâ€™s money supply is distributed evenly (by CPU power) throughout the network, not monopolized by banks.
      </li>
    </ul>

  <div class="question">
    <h2>There's no point in having a bank for decentralized currency!</h2>
    <p>
      The concept of an usual bank obviously doesn't apply for a decentralized and anonymous currency,
      traditional banks mostly make their money by :
    <ul>
      <li>Paying interests on deposits,</li>
      <li>Charging interests on loans,</li>
      <li>and keeping the resulting difference.</li>
      <li>They also make money by charging various service fees.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Using the bitcoin system there will obviously no loans granted since it won't be possible to hold
      anyone liable for the resulting debt repayments.
    </p>

  <div class="question">
    <h2>So? What is this concept based on?</h2>
    <p>
      Well, the whole bank-for-bitcoins concept is based on the idea that, eventually, lots of people will
      buy goods and services using bitcoins, and most people not really caring about running bitcoin nodes.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      A bitcoin based bank would help addressing some bitcoin-specific issues :
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Eliminate transaction confirmation delays when transactions are between two bank users,</li>
      <li>Eliminate the need to back your wallet up, it's taken care of for you,</li>
      <li>Provide an easy entry-point for bitcoin related trading,</li>
      <li>Provide dead-easy tools and resources for merchants to implement bitcoin-enabled online shops,</li>
      <li>Provide a much more user-friendly interface to people who don't really care about the bitcoin internals,</li>
      <li>Provide functionality that would increase bitcoin adoption as a currency like sending bitcoins in e-mail for example.</li>
    </ul>

  <div class="question">
    <h2>How are you going to make money?</h2>
    <p>
      I expect to make money in the long run by charging very small transaction fees when payments go to merchant accounts.
    </p>
    <p>
      The amount that would be charged would be smaller than the average amount charged for bitcoin transactions which would make a
      win-win-win deal between the two parties and the bank : faster transactions for cheaper !
    </p>
    <p>
      As of now, everything is completely free!

  <div class="question">
    <h2>How can I add funds to my account?</h2>
    <p>
      You can simply transfer Liberty Reserve USD or EUR by using the relevant menu option.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can also add bitcoins by simply transferring them to one of your bitcoin addresses (your latest address is in the upper right corner when you are signed-in).
